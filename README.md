# Timeless IS

Timeless IS is a web-based management software for a franchise of hookah bars called "Timeless Lounge"

## Current state

Timeless Lounge is currently using a set of software tools were developed around an external application called [Poster](https://joinposter.com/en) that is also providing APi to access data.
This application is not flexible enough, does not cover all the needs for process automation, therefore there is a need to develop full-fledged information system designed to combine the experience gained in automating processes in lounge bars and support the expansion of the franchise network.

## Non-functional requirements

### Technology stack

* Python 3.7.2 - programming language
* Flask - backend framework;
* React - backend framework;
* PostgreSQL - permanent storage;
* Redis - cache storage;

### Usability

The application should be able to work on any computer displays as well as mobile devices (smartphones and tablets). The interface of the application should be sophisticated, but simple, self-explanatory and intuitive

### Security

* Authentication by login/password
* Management of the users/roles (map users to roles, grant/revoke permissions, etc.)

### Fault tolerance

Very important for us in case of serious software/hardware failure. The system should not lose/corrupt data (regular database backups) and we should able to restore system performance within 15 minutes (master-slave replication and failover should be configured).
