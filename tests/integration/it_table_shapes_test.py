    #  the specifics on how to check the amount of returned table shapes and specific table shape details is exposed
    #  directly in client code. There is a need to have a so called Page Object abstraction for the table_shapes.list
    #  route that will encapsulate parsing, length and index access in a single entity, having a single place to fix in
    #  case UI layout is changed. Please consider following draft client code as a reference:
    #  table_shapes = TableShapes(client, filter_by=["description=B"]
    #  assert len(table_shapes) == 1
    #  assert iter(table_shapes).next().id == 1
    # @todo #260:30min Uncomment below assertion and fix the test once #273 is fixed.
    #  Currently there is an issue with template caching which is reported by #273 1st point. Lets uncomment
    #  below assertion checking if filter logic works as expected by checking table shapes rendered within list route.

# @todo #206:30min Fix timeless.forms.ModelForm so it will use instance

#  test_edit and test_delete. Both were disabled because picture validation was
#  added but the form for it wasn't updated, so create method doesn't save
#  anything right now.
