"""Integration tests for Location Sync with database

    @todo #232:30min Location poster mock refactor. To simplify future 
     poster mock creation PosterServerMock were refactored as a 
     generic server for postermocks (PosterServerMock in
     tests/integration/poster/poster_integration_mock.py). Implement a mock 
     location server based on PosterServerMock implementation.
    @todo #232:30min Refactor it_sync_location_test.py to use factory-created 
     mocks. Create Location in factories so we can use it instead fixed
     mocks. The refactor the tests below so they pass again
