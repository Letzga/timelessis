@todo #169:30min Write test for creating and editing Table model. To test
 it correctly it's needed to create relations like `TableShape` and so on
 in tests. There is`factory-boy` library in requirements added. It helps
 to create instance with its relations automatically, look at
 `tests/factories.py` and see
 https://factoryboy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/orms.html#sqlalchemy. Implement
 these factories for related models and then write tests.
