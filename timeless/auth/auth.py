    @todo #370:30min Decouple routines from database. Database 
     implementation and routines are tightly coupled, which prevents 
     unit testing. Decouple Employee model from routines creating Employee and
     Employees abstractions (see 
     https://github.com/timelesslounge/timelessis/pull/375) for examples. 
     Then create mocks and use these mocks to test auth.
