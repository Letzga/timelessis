"""Generic classes for API views and Template views.
@todo #173:30min Implement checking for permissions (like is user logged in or
 is user in role) using decorators for view. For that, create new view which
 all other views will extend. Example would be:
 class AdminView(View):
 ....decorators = [auth.admin_required, auth.login_required]
 class UserView(AdminView):
@todo #173:30min Once CreateView is implemented, refactor all blueprint views
 to use it for validating the form and storing the record in the database.
@todo #173:30min Once UpdateView is implemented, refactor all blueprint views
 to use it for validating the form and updating the record in the database.
 Reuse SingleObjectMixin to provide simple solution to fetch by id.
@todo #173:30min Once DeleteView is implemented, refactor all blueprint views
 to use it for validating the form and deleting the record in the database.
 Reuse SingleObjectMixin to provide simple solution to fetch by id.
@todo #309:30min Refactor all blueprint views to use ListView for getting the
 list of objects from db using model. Also, make sure list.html template is
 made generic to allow all other views to use it. Feel free to add more puzzles
 since there are a lot of views. Already refactored views: TableListView. Check
 in issues to see if some view is not being refactored in other issue.

Example of using CrudAPIView:

class CommentView(CrudView):

     model = Comment
     url_lookup = "comment_id"

@todo #221:30min Remove references to database objects. we should not tie
 our view layer to our database objects. We should create some form of
 abstraction to handle the model calls, for example,
 model.query.get(object_id) that would decorate the real implementation,
 eliminating the coupling here.
