     our view layer to our database objects. We should create some form of
     abstraction to handle the model calls, for example,
     model.query.get(object_id) that would decorate the real implementation,
     eliminating the coupling here.

    @todo #221:30min Continue with the implementation of CrudAPIView.
     Implement get, post, put and delete methods. We should return json representation of object model in methods. Use 
     FakeModel for a fake database object, and implement the desired calls on FakeQuery to get, create, save / update 
     and delete returnin the result. Don't forget to implement the tests too, to test if CrudAPIView code is being 
     called and returning the expected objects; please refer to #221 and #222 for documentation. After that remove the 
     ignore annotation from tests on test_crud_api.py.
